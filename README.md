## Developement setup üîß
The TS3 Manager is written in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). The latest LTS version of NodeJS including NPM needs to be installed.

### Folder structure üìÅ
The project is split into two directories. The frontend is handling everything what the user sees. Even the routing is handled by the frontend. The backend communicates with the TeamSpeak ServerQuery and sends the responses back to the frontend. Frontend and backend are talking to each other over websockets.
